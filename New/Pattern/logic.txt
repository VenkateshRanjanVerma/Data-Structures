logic in the Pattern problem:


1. We always use nested loops for printing the patterns. For the outer loop, we count the number of lines/rows and loop for them.

2. Next, for the inner loop, we focus on the number of columns and somehow connect them to the rows by forming a logic such that for each row we get the required number of columns to be printed.
